# Geyser
A bridge between Minecraft: Java Edition and Minecraft: Bedrock edition, breaking the gap from those wanting to play together.

## What is Geyser?
Geyser is a (heavy work in progress) connector (or proxy), bridging the gap between Minecraft: Bedrock Edition and Minecraft: Java Edition servers.
The ultimate goal for this project is to allow those to join Minecraft: Java Edition servers using the Bedrock Edition.

### Please note, this project is still a HEAVY work in progress and probably won't be complete any time soon.
